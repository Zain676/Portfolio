                I build things for the web with a passion for solving problems through code. Currently balancing the worlds of development and academia, I'm a full-stack developer who loves the entire journey from designing intuitive interfaces to making them come alive with functionality.

            <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                From building my first simple landing page to crafting complex admin dashboards, I've discovered that good development is about understanding people as much as understanding code. The MERN stack became my tool of choice because it lets me move quickly from idea to implementation while ensuring a smooth experience for users.

            <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me working as the student focal person at ORIC, where I help bridge the gap between students and research opportunities. I believe strongly in the power of community - that's why I volunteer with Each One Teach One, helping others develop their skills and find their path in tech.

            <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                There's magic in turning abstract concepts into something tangible that people can use. Whether it's a small tool that solves a specific problem or a complex system that drives a business, I thrive on that moment when everything comes together and makes someone's life or work just a little bit better.
