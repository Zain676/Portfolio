        I’m Muhammad Zain, a full-stack web developer with a strong focus on
        creating robust, scalable, and high-performance web applications using
        the MERN stack. My passion lies in building technology that makes lives
        easier, streamlines business processes, and inspires innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since beginning my journey in development, I've built everything from
        static websites to full-stack enterprise-level applications. I’m
        proficient in JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, and I actively
        contribute to open-source and freelance projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I’m an active contributor to university clubs, research
        initiatives, and community teaching efforts. I serve as the student
        focal person at ORIC and manage internal and external communication for
        several university events and projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mission is to continuously improve my craft while mentoring others
        and staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends. I believe in
        lifelong learning and collaboration as a force multiplier in this
        digital age.
